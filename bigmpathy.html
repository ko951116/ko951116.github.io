                        This semester we worked in partnership with MCT2D, to tackle the following problems: 
                        First, The traditional approach to diabetes treatment is flawed. Second, As new methods and treatments emerge it’s important for healthcare professionals to stay up to date. Third, Diabetes care involves a lot of collaboration and this process is not always easy.
                        <br><br>
                        MCT2D hopes to overcome these barriers by creating a platform to foster collaborative learning between clinicians treating Type 2 Diabetes to facilitate the exchange of new ideas and treatment methods to ensure patients are receiving the best care.

                    <p>As you can see from the picture below, the masks we use consist of layers made of different materials. Among them, Polypropylene(PP) is one of the most commonly used types of plastics, which can actually be recycled. The problem is that in the case of masks, layers of various materials overlap, so it is difficult to extract only recyclable PP materials and recycle them properly. Therefore, experts believe that while recycling of masks may be technically possible, it is not economically feasible to recycle them as high value-added products.</p>

                        We conducted contextual inquiry and structured individual interviews. We conducted five interviews in total with interpreter service schedulers, interpreter supervisor, and interpreters. Each interview took an hour and we made annotated notes for every interview.

                        The key takeaway here was being able to better understand and empathize with interviewees as we were in their working context together. Before each meeting, we created comprehensive interview protocols asking tailored questions for each interviewees. While conducting interviews, we were sitting next to interviewees, observing every detail to gain better insights.

                    We conducted interpretation sessions for every interview. During these sessions, each team member walked through their annotated notes with other members in details so we could synthesize all data, findings and insights together.

                    Based on our interpretation sessions, we created extensive affinity diagram. We met every week spending about four to six hours to categorize interview contents, quotes, and other contextual information. Going through iterative grouping affinity notes process allowed us to discover underlying problems of our client, which later became the foundations of our recommendations.

                            After we had conducted our user research and derived insights from our affinity wall, we began brainstorming possible solutions around the key challenges we had uncovered. 
                            To evaluate the solutions we had brainstormed as a team we used a decision making process that involved identifying key criteria for a successful solution, giving those criteria weights based on importance, and then scoring each recommendation against those criteria.

                        <b>Collaboration with people of various backgrounds.</b>
                        <br>It was not only about learning a holistic design process but an opportunity to work together
                        with various people from different background. We all have a different background such as
                        engineering, industrial design and UX design and even our nationalities were different like
                        South Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Australia. It was such a wonderful experiences to work
                        with different people. It was my first time collaborating with an industrial design major, and
                        for me, who liked design and learning, the process of collaborating with industrial design team
                        members was enjoyable and I could learn many new things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Make the world a better place.</b>
                        <br>The greatest part of this project was that we enjoyed the project itself. In this pandemic,
                        we were happy that we tried to create something useful for human kind. Although we know that our
                        project may be difficult to realize in reality due to various constraints, it was a project that
                        started with the hope that our project would actually be realized in the near future and solve
                        the problem of disposable masks around the world. This project made me more interested in
                        understanding and solving problems in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Cooperation in the COVID-19 pandemic.</b>
                        <br>The camp, which was held during the Pandemics season due to COVID-19, was held online. All
                        meetings, except field trips and 3D prototyping, were conducted online (mostly through Zoom and
                        MIRO), and so sometimes there were misunderstandings between each other. But for about two
                        weeks, we gradually learned how to collaborate and work with colleagues in this pandemic era. I
                        think it was a good opportunity to learn directly how to collaborate with colleagues even
                        through online.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>As a team leader.</b>
                        <br>I was the team leader of Team 8 from the start. Obviously, it was never easy to pull people
                        from different backgrounds, including nationality and major, into one team. However, all the
                        team members faithfully performed their duties in the fields they could do, making it relatively
                        easy to lead the team in a good direction. I think this good teamwork, along with good project
                        results, contributed to displaying the project at the DK festival. Once again, thank the team
                        members for working together on the project.
                    </p>
