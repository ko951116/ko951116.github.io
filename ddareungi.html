                        Ddareungi is a shared bicycle service operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, which has been widely used since its launch in 2015. 
                        It is so famous and familiar service that any Seoul citizen has heard of it at least once. 

                        <br><br>However, people's assessment of this application is low. 
                        As a user of Ddareungi, I also sometimes felt uncomfortable with the application.
                         Therefore, I worked on redesign to improve the UX and UI of Ddareungi application.

                    <p>As you can see from the picture below, the masks we use consist of layers made of different materials. Among them, Polypropylene(PP) is one of the most commonly used types of plastics, which can actually be recycled. The problem is that in the case of masks, layers of various materials overlap, so it is difficult to extract only recyclable PP materials and recycle them properly. Therefore, experts believe that while recycling of masks may be technically possible, it is not economically feasible to recycle them as high value-added products.</p>

                            Some users find the Ddareungi too uncomfortable to use, especially because of some complex features.
                            The user experience of the application should be improved by considering users of various ages and different purposes of use.

                            In particular, there were so many small letters and no icons on the ticket purchase page that people felt uncomfortable purchasing tickets.

                                    For random users, it is burdensome to enter a password when they first sign up. In a situation where a bicycle is urgently needed, there may be a lack of time to set a password carefully, and it may be embarrassing to forget the password when the bike needs to be used again later.
                                    Therefore, every time a bicycle is rented, it is changed to a temporary password of four digits.

                            as the Ddareungi app needs to be constantly checked to check the remaining time. 
                            The Ddareungi app needs a directions function to the destination.

                            so users use another health record app, 
                            but it is difficult to see exactly how much they exercised with just a bicycle 
                            because the Ddareungi is not exclusive. 
                            Therefore, it is necessary to display the driving time, distance, and calories consumed in real time, 
                            and to collect the data and check it on a monthly or daily basis.

                         <h4 class="sub-title-smaller">Solution 04: Alarm & Extending the remaining time </h4>

                         <div class="list-content">
                            <div class="list">
                                <p class="list-title"><span>1</span><b>Alarm</b></p>

                                <p>
                                    Currently, when using the Ddareungi, the alarm is indirectly notified through Kakao Talk 10 minutes before the remaining time. 
                                    The problem is, some people do not use Kakao Talk, and people do not easily recognize that it is an alarm when riding because it is not an alarm that comes from the app itself. 
                                    Therefore, the Ddareungi app gives an alarm five minutes before returning it with a loud vibration or sound on its own so that users can easily recognize the remaining time while even riding.

                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    When the alarm goes off as shown above, users can extend it on the app if they want to. However, it is only possible to extend it once for the smooth sharing of bicycles among citizens.

                        The information architecture of the service is consists of a login page, a map, an alarm and buying a ticket. 
                        Once the user logs in, the user can see a map to check his or her location and the location of the bicycle rental station.
                        The map allows the user to perform a variety of functions, of which clicking Buy Ticket will switch to the screen for the purchase of the ticket. 
                        When the rental time approaches, it automatically switches to the alarm screen.

                        💡 Ddareungi is a service used by various age groups <b>from teenagers to 60s</b>. Therefore, small letters and numbers are hard to read for older people, so <b>the size of the letters should be increased</b>.

                        <br>💡 When renting a bicycle, it is necessary to explain the <b>4-digit rental number</b> and the <b>extension of the rental time</b>.

                         The extension can only be made once for smooth bike sharing, 
                         and the extension time is determined by the ticket and automatically paid with the registered card.

                        This was my first UX project. After I became interested in UX design, I studied about UX by myself online and through books. After that, I wanted to do a related project. I started redesigning the application based on my personal discomfort with the Ddareungi application, which I often used, and the poor rating on the App Store.

                        <br><br>Because it was the first UX work, the process took a long time and it was difficult. However, the process of understanding and improving people's discomfort was fun. I worked on the parts I didn't know by asking my friend who majored in UX design. (Thank you, Jeonghye:))

                        <br><br>Above all, I organized this work well with a portfolio and submitted it to a company, and I was able to work as a UX design intern. 
                        Later, I heard from my boss that although I had no experience in UX design, I studied UX and learned design tools all night long, so he highly appreciated my passion for the project.

                        <br><br>What's really unfortunate is that I couldn't do the user survey for a long time because it was an early work and I didn't have enough time. If I had gotten answers from more diverse users, I could have redesigned the Ddareungi application in a better way. Through this first task, I was able to realize the importance of user survey.
