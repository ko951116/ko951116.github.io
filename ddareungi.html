                        Ddareungi is a shared bicycle service operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, which has been widely used since its launch in 2015. 
                        It is so famous and familiar service that any Seoul citizen has heard of it at least once. 

                        <br><br>However, people's assessment of this application is low. 
                        As a user of Ddareungi, I also sometimes felt uncomfortable with the application.
                         Therefore, I worked on redesign to improve the UX and UI of Ddareungi application.

                    <p>As you can see from the picture below, the masks we use consist of layers made of different materials. Among them, Polypropylene(PP) is one of the most commonly used types of plastics, which can actually be recycled. The problem is that in the case of masks, layers of various materials overlap, so it is difficult to extract only recyclable PP materials and recycle them properly. Therefore, experts believe that while recycling of masks may be technically possible, it is not economically feasible to recycle them as high value-added products.</p>

                                    For random users, it is burdensome to enter a password when they first sign up. In a situation where a bicycle is urgently needed, there may be a lack of time to set a password carefully, and it may be embarrassing to forget the password when the bike needs to be used again later.
                                    Therefore, every time a bicycle is rented, it is changed to a temporary password of four digits.

                            Random users who urgently need bicycles to their destinations and sports users who want to exercise their bikes on the course they want have to use different directions applications. 
                            It is not only inconvenient to check back and forth between two applications, but also dangerous while riding a bicycle, 
                            as the Ddareungi app needs to be constantly checked to check the remaining time. 
                            The Ddareungi app needs a directions function to the destination.

                            so users use another health record app, 
                            but it is difficult to see exactly how much they exercised with just a bicycle 
                            because the Ddareungi is not exclusive. 
                            Therefore, it is necessary to display the driving time, distance, and calories consumed in real time, 
                            and to collect the data and check it on a monthly or daily basis.

                         <h4 class="sub-title-smaller">Solution 04: Alarm & Extending the remaining time </h4>

                         <div class="list-content">
                            <div class="list">
                                <p class="list-title"><span>1</span><b>Alarm</b></p>

                                <p>
                                    Currently, when using the Ddareungi, the alarm is indirectly notified through Kakao Talk 10 minutes before the remaining time. 
                                    The problem is, some people do not use Kakao Talk, and people do not easily recognize that it is an alarm when riding because it is not an alarm that comes from the app itself. 
                                    Therefore, the Ddareungi app gives an alarm five minutes before returning it with a loud vibration or sound on its own so that users can easily recognize the remaining time while even riding.

                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    When the alarm goes off as shown above, users can extend it on the app if they want to. However, it is only possible to extend it once for the smooth sharing of bicycles among citizens.

                        The information architecture of the service is consists of a login page, a map, an alarm and buying a ticket. 
                        Once the user logs in, the user can see a map to check his or her location and the location of the bicycle rental station.
                        The map allows the user to perform a variety of functions, of which clicking Buy Ticket will switch to the screen for the purchase of the ticket. 
                        When the rental time approaches, it automatically switches to the alarm screen.

                        💡 Ddareungi is a service used by various age groups <b>from teenagers to 60s</b>. Therefore, small letters and numbers are hard to read for older people, so <b>the size of the letters should be increased</b>.

                        <br>💡 When renting a bicycle, it is necessary to explain the <b>4-digit rental number</b> and the <b>extension of the rental time</b>.

                        <br>It was not only about learning a holistic design process but an opportunity to work together
                        with various people from different background. We all have a different background such as
                        engineering, industrial design and UX design and even our nationalities were different like
                        South Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Australia. It was such a wonderful experiences to work
                        with different people. It was my first time collaborating with an industrial design major, and
                        for me, who liked design and learning, the process of collaborating with industrial design team
                        members was enjoyable and I could learn many new things.

                        <br>The greatest part of this project was that we enjoyed the project itself. In this pandemic,
                        we were happy that we tried to create something useful for human kind. Although we know that our
                        project may be difficult to realize in reality due to various constraints, it was a project that
                        started with the hope that our project would actually be realized in the near future and solve
                        the problem of disposable masks around the world. This project made me more interested in
                        understanding and solving problems in the world.

                        <b>Cooperation in the COVID-19 pandemic.</b>
                        <br>The camp, which was held during the Pandemics season due to COVID-19, was held online. All
                        meetings, except field trips and 3D prototyping, were conducted online (mostly through Zoom and
                        MIRO), and so sometimes there were misunderstandings between each other. But for about two
                        weeks, we gradually learned how to collaborate and work with colleagues in this pandemic era. I
                        think it was a good opportunity to learn directly how to collaborate with colleagues even
                        through online.
