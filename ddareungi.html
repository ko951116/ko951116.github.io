                    <p>In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic occured in the world. As the situation became more serious,
                        many people wore face masks to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Face masks are part of our
                        daily lives during this pandemic. Many of them are designed to be used just once, which means
                        thousands of tonnes of waste.
                        <br><br>Every month some 129 billion disposable masks are now being consumed in the world due to
                        the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. They have worsened the amount of plastic polluting the
                        world’s landfill and oceans. Disposable masks contain plastics which pollute water and can harm
                        wildlife who eat them or become tangled in them.
                        <br><br>As a solution for these issues, we designed a creative and holistic integrated system to
                        solve the wastage problem caused by the improper disposal of single use face masks.

                    <p>As you can see from the picture below, the masks we use consist of layers made of different materials. Among them, Polypropylene(PP) is one of the most commonly used types of plastics, which can actually be recycled. The problem is that in the case of masks, layers of various materials overlap, so it is difficult to extract only recyclable PP materials and recycle them properly. Therefore, experts believe that while recycling of masks may be technically possible, it is not economically feasible to recycle them as high value-added products.</p>

                        <b>Collaboration with people of various backgrounds.</b>
                        <br>It was not only about learning a holistic design process but an opportunity to work together
                        with various people from different background. We all have a different background such as
                        engineering, industrial design and UX design and even our nationalities were different like
                        South Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Australia. It was such a wonderful experiences to work
                        with different people. It was my first time collaborating with an industrial design major, and
                        for me, who liked design and learning, the process of collaborating with industrial design team
                        members was enjoyable and I could learn many new things.

                        <b>Make the world a better place.</b>
                        <br>The greatest part of this project was that we enjoyed the project itself. In this pandemic,
                        we were happy that we tried to create something useful for human kind. Although we know that our
                        project may be difficult to realize in reality due to various constraints, it was a project that
                        started with the hope that our project would actually be realized in the near future and solve
                        the problem of disposable masks around the world. This project made me more interested in
                        understanding and solving problems in the world.

                        <b>Cooperation in the COVID-19 pandemic.</b>
                        <br>The camp, which was held during the Pandemics season due to COVID-19, was held online. All
                        meetings, except field trips and 3D prototyping, were conducted online (mostly through Zoom and
                        MIRO), and so sometimes there were misunderstandings between each other. But for about two
                        weeks, we gradually learned how to collaborate and work with colleagues in this pandemic era. I
                        think it was a good opportunity to learn directly how to collaborate with colleagues even
                        through online.
