                    <p>With the rise of VR technology, more realistic experiences are possible,
                        and tourism using these virtual reality contents is having a positive impact on the revitalization of the local tourism industry.
                        
                        <br><br>So we started to develop a program to explore historical sites through VR,
                        which allows us to tour 'Gyeongbokgung Palace' in Seoul by incorporating VR technology into tourism.

                            is increasing, and therefore the number of travelers is increasing.
                            However, depending on the circumstances, they may not be able
                            to come to Korea directly, so we started the project to solve

                    <p>
                        This machine is about recycling and get money back like Pfand system in Europe. The can is 7 points, PET bottle is 5 points. If the point exceeds 2000 points, user can change it into real money. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>INSIGHT 01</strong>
                        <br>It was easy to use it because there was a information like illustration, and video about how to use. It also needs to be notice exactly what materials can be put inside the machine. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>INSIGHT 02</strong>
                        <br>Unlike this machine, our machine does not need big screen to touch because it can be problem about infection. So using app instead of putting big screen on the machine is better, we think.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>INSIGHT 03</strong>
                        <br>It should be noticed if the machine is full. We went to two other different machines. The first one was full so we couldn’t use it. We didn’t know if it was full so it was inconvenient.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>INSIGHT 04</strong>
                        <br>It needs to place other garbage bin next to the machine. Like I said above, we went to two machines and near the first one there was no garbage bins, and also plastic bottle was threw next to the machine. The next one, there was another recycling bin close to the machine. Then it was so clear around, so we may be need to consider this because people may think if the machine is another garbage bin.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>INSIGHT 05</strong>
                        <br>Maybe we can put sanitizer next to machine, because we are touching used mask instead of PET or can. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>INSIGHT 06</strong>
                        <br>It would be better if the entrance of the garbage closed, like we said before for sterilization.

                        <p>Before we start working on DIY design, we decided to make an item ourselves using a mask. The reason for making this prototype was to experience the process of making the necessary items using the masks that you used which is the overall purpose of the project. It was also because we had to know what the results of our project would look like and what people will experience in the process of making it.

                        <p>The overall project development environment is Unity, and the development language is C#. To implement the login system, a script was written in C# language inside Unity and it is connected to a PHP file, and then the contents of the Web DB were imported. As an application development tool, we used Android Studio 3.0 version SDK and Java JDK1.8.0_172. Target devices are Android operating system devices.

                        <p>We needed a server to manage the user's information, so we bought a 64bit JSP light-hosting from Cafe 24 (www.cafe24.com). 
                            Sign up and login pages are implemented using Unity's UI. 
                            We used C# scripts and php files to access the server's db, enabling login and sign up.

                            VRNoThanks script was added to the login scene so that it could be seen on a regular screen, while VRYesPlease script was added to the main menu scene, the second scene, to make all subsequent scenes work in VR mode.

                            <p>The camp, which was held during the Pandemics season due to COVID-19, was held online. All meetings, except field trips and prototyping, were conducted online, and so sometimes there were misunderstandings between each other. But for about two weeks, we gradually learned how to collaborate and work with colleagues in this Corona era. Personally, I think it was a good opportunity to learn directly how to collaborate with colleagues in these situations.</p>
                            <p>It was not only about learning a design process but an opportunity to work together with various people from different background. We all have a different background such as engineering, industrial design and UX design and even our nationalities were different like South Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Australia. It was such a wonderful experiences to work with different people. It was my first time collaborating with an industrial design major, and for me, who liked design and learning, the process of collaborating with industrial design team members was enjoyable and I could learn many new things.

                            <p>The great part of this project was that we enjoyed the working process. In this pandemic, we were happy that we tried to create something useful for human kind. Although we know that our project may be difficult to realize in reality due to various constraints, it was a project that started with the hope that our project would actually be realized in the near future and solve the problem of disposable masks around the world. </p>
                            <p>I was the team leader of Team 8 from the start. Obviously, it was never easy to pull people from different backgrounds, including nationality and major, into one team. However, all the team members faithfully performed their duties in the fields they could do, making it relatively easy to lead the team in a good direction. I think this good teamwork, along with good project results, contributed to winning the Best Project Award at the end of the camp. Once again, thank the team members from all over the world for working together on the project.</p>
