                    <p>In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic occured in the world. As the situation became more serious,
                        many people wore face masks to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Face masks are part of our
                        daily lives during this pandemic. Many of them are designed to be used just once, which means
                        thousands of tonnes of waste.
                        <br><br>Every month some 129 billion disposable masks are now being consumed in the world due to
                        the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. They have worsened the amount of plastic polluting the
                        worldâ€™s landfill and oceans. Disposable masks contain plastics which pollute water and can harm
                        wildlife who eat them or become tangled in them.
                        <br><br>As a solution for these issues, we designed a creative and holistic integrated system to
                        solve the wastage problem caused by the improper disposal of single use face masks.

                        <strong>INSIGHT 01</strong>
                        <br>It was easy to use it because there was a information like illustration, and video about how to use. It also needs to be notice exactly what materials can be put inside the machine. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>INSIGHT 02</strong>
                        <br>Unlike this machine, our machine does not need big screen to touch because it can be problem about infection. So using app instead of putting big screen on the machine is better, we think.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>INSIGHT 03</strong>
                        <br>It should be noticed if the machine is full. We went to two other different machines. The first one was full so we couldnâ€™t use it. We didnâ€™t know if it was full so it was inconvenient.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>INSIGHT 04</strong>
                        <br>It needs to place other garbage bin next to the machine. Like I said above, we went to two machines and near the first one there was no garbage bins, and also plastic bottle was threw next to the machine. The next one, there was another recycling bin close to the machine. Then it was so clear around, so we may be need to consider this because people may think if the machine is another garbage bin.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>INSIGHT 05</strong>
                        <br>Maybe we can put sanitizer next to machine, because we are touching used mask instead of PET or can. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>INSIGHT 06</strong>
                        <br>It would be better if the entrance of the garbage closed, like we said before for sterilization.

                        <p>To collect and recycle masks, you first have to decide how to collect them. We decided to
                            design a device to collect used masks, and explored it in various directions. </p>

                        <h3>Considerations</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sterilizing bin to collect and treat used masks</li>
                            <li>Could be small product be retrofit to home bins?</li>
                            <li>Separated components can be safely treated at industrial scale and repurposed </li>
                            <li>Could be made of this repurposed mask material</li>
                            <li>Designated option for disposal of masks (addresses pain point)</li>
                            <li>Sterilizing (UV, Steam or heat)</li>
                            <li>Could be positioned at areas where people regularly attend (Grocery store, Outside train
                                station)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Vending Machine Design Ideas</h3>
                        <p>Combining various early sketches and considerations, there seemed to be a problem that
                            letting people sterilize or separate masks on their own at home would not only reduce
                            participation rates but also complicate the distribution process. Furthermore, since the
                            device is only one step in our project and is not the final goal, considering the steps
                            after collecting the mask, the device used at home seemed to be constrained. Thus we decided
                            on <b>a device in the form of a large vending machine</b> installed for anyone to use outdoors.
                            After selecting the machine form, we started a research on vending machines and began
                            brainstorming design ideas.</p>
                        <p>
                            And we decided not only to collect the mask, but also to design a system that will allow it
                            to be returned to the person who put it after a complete sterilization and cutting process
                            for recycling products.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We have to think about what products people finally get. We explored about the product
                            considering the functions that the product will have.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Considerations</h3>

                            <li>Prodect size</li>
                            <li>Function (protection, awareness, enjoyment, education, construction, etc.)</li>

                        <h3>DIY Design Ideas</h3>
                        <p>We looked at the various outcomes of the project and chose DIY products that people could
                            make their own products. This is because <b>people can feel small happiness during these
                            difficult times while making DIY</b>, and directly feel the <b>feeling of recycling masks while
                            making their own results</b>. Below are some of the selected sketches that we were going to
                            focus on a little bit more.

                        The reverse vending machine will be located on the street. It has a QR code on the front for the scan with the app. 
                        The vending machine should have the functions of sterilization and shredding. 
                        The user can get the sterilized, chopped mask sheets from the vending machine and can use them to make a small DIY product.

                            masks which is the overall purpose of the project. It was also because we had to
                            know what the results of our project would look like and what people will experience in the

                        <b>Collaboration with people of various backgrounds.</b>
                        <br>It was not only about learning a holistic design process but an opportunity to work together
                        with various people from different background. We all have a different background such as
                        engineering, industrial design and UX design and even our nationalities were different like
                        South Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Australia. It was such a wonderful experiences to work
                        with different people. It was my first time collaborating with an industrial design major, and
                        for me, who liked design and learning, the process of collaborating with industrial design team
                        members was enjoyable and I could learn many new things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Make the world a better place.</b>
                        <br>The greatest part of this project was that we enjoyed the project itself. In this pandemic,
                        we were happy that we tried to create something useful for human kind. Although we know that our
                        project may be difficult to realize in reality due to various constraints, it was a project that
                        started with the hope that our project would actually be realized in the near future and solve
                        the problem of disposable masks around the world. This project made me more interested in
                        understanding and solving problems in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Cooperation in the COVID-19 pandemic.</b>
                        <br>The camp, which was held during the Pandemics season due to COVID-19, was held online. All
                        meetings, except field trips and 3D prototyping, were conducted online (mostly through Zoom and
                        MIRO), and so sometimes there were misunderstandings between each other. But for about two
                        weeks, we gradually learned how to collaborate and work with colleagues in this pandemic era. I
                        think it was a good opportunity to learn directly how to collaborate with colleagues even
                        through online.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>As a team leader.</b>
                        <br>I was the team leader of Team 8 from the start. Obviously, it was never easy to pull people
                        from different backgrounds, including nationality and major, into one team. However, all the
                        team members faithfully performed their duties in the fields they could do, making it relatively
                        easy to lead the team in a good direction. I think this good teamwork, along with good project
                        results, contributed to displaying the project at the DK festival. Once again, thank the team
                        members for working together on the project.
                    </p>
