                    <p>With the rise of VR technology, more realistic experiences are possible,
                        and tourism using these virtual reality contents is having a positive impact on the revitalization of the local tourism industry.
                        
                        <br><br>So we started to develop a program to explore historical sites through VR,
                        which allows us to tour 'Gyeongbokgung Palace' in Seoul by incorporating VR technology into tourism.

                            <strong>coordinator</strong>
                            <p>The camp, which was held during the Pandemics season due to COVID-19, was held online. All meetings, except field trips and prototyping, were conducted online, and so sometimes there were misunderstandings between each other. But for about two weeks, we gradually learned how to collaborate and work with colleagues in this Corona era. Personally, I think it was a good opportunity to learn directly how to collaborate with colleagues in these situations.</p>
                            
                            <strong>coordinator</strong>
                            <p>It was not only about learning a design process but an opportunity to work together with various people from different background. We all have a different background such as engineering, industrial design and UX design and even our nationalities were different like South Korea, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Australia. It was such a wonderful experiences to work with different people. It was my first time collaborating with an industrial design major, and for me, who liked design and learning, the process of collaborating with industrial design team members was enjoyable and I could learn many new things.
                            </p>
                            
                            <strong>coordinator</strong>
                            <p>The great part of this project was that we enjoyed the working process. In this pandemic, we were happy that we tried to create something useful for human kind. Although we know that our project may be difficult to realize in reality due to various constraints, it was a project that started with the hope that our project would actually be realized in the near future and solve the problem of disposable masks around the world. </p>
                            
                            <strong>coordinator</strong>
                            <p>I was the team leader of Team 8 from the start. Obviously, it was never easy to pull people from different backgrounds, including nationality and major, into one team. However, all the team members faithfully performed their duties in the fields they could do, making it relatively easy to lead the team in a good direction. I think this good teamwork, along with good project results, contributed to winning the Best Project Award at the end of the camp. Once again, thank the team members from all over the world for working together on the project.</p>
